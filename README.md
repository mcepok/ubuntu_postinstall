# Ubuntu Post Installation

**The scripts are currently in development and not everything (or rather much) is working yet.**

**The scripts are using sudo and are installing a lot. Use on fresh installations only. The scripts might (will) break existing configurations!**

**And don't run scripts (including the ones in this repo) which asks you for sudo rights without having them reviewed by a person you really trust.**

That being said, the scripts are mainly for myself to apply on fresh Ubuntu machines so I save time setting up new machines. But I wont hinder you using and/or adjusting them for yourself. However, you do it on your own responsibility.


## HowTo

Checkout this repo (or download the zip), change into the root directory of this project and run
